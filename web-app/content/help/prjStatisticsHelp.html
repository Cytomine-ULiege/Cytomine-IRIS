    <h4>Project Statistics Dashboard</h4>
    The project statistics dashboard is divided into tabs, which allow different views on the annotations.
    <ul>
        <li><b>User Statistics</b>: lets you combine various filters and view the histogram of assigned labels for
            one or more users.
        </li>
        <li><b>Annotation Agreements</b>: lets you combine various filters and view inter-observer agreement on the annotations.
        </li>
    </ul>
    In both cases, a filter panel as shown below allows you to construct your query.
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>User Filter</b>
            <br>
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-filterpanel-1.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>Ontology Filter</b>
            <br>
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-filterpanel-2.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>Image Filter</b>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Well, I don't see the filter!?</h5>
        <p>
            The filter panel can be hidden by selecting the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span> icon
            or clicking the gray bar on the left side of the window.
            Similarly, the panel can be shown by selecting the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> icon
            or clicking the gray bar on the left side of the window.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>User Statistics</h4>
    User statistics allow a complete picture of all terms assigned by one or more particular users.
    Select users from the left hand side you want to examine, choose one or more terms or images and then select
    <span class="btn btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Refresh</span> in the main view.
    <br>
    You can also hide the filter panel by clicking on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span> icon
    or the grey bar at the left border of the window.

    <div class="text-center" style="margin-top:20px;">
        <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-user-histogram.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            For each user there will be one histogram and two progress bars.
            The histogram contains the filtered labels and hovering the bars in the chart indicates the frequency of that term
            for the user.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The name of the user</li>
                <li>Total number of annotations labeled by the user</li>
                <li>Total number of annotations with one or more labels</li>
                <li>Total number of annotations (also includes annotations without labels)</li>
            </ol>
            The first progress bar indicates the progress relative to the observer who labeled most annotations of all users,
            which is the total number of annotations by the user divided by all annotations with labels.
            So example, if the first progressbar is at 100%, this means that this particular user has assigned most of all terms.
            <br>
            The second progress bar indicates the overall progress: total number of labeled annotations by the user divided by all annotations.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-user-description.png"/>
        </div>
    </div>



    <hr>
    <div>
        <h4>Annotation Agreements</h4>
        The agreements among particular users can be viewed by selecting this tab.
        Similar to the user statistics, you can construct a query by using the filter panels shown on the left hand side.
        Also, this panel can be hidden by clicking on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span> if more
        space for displaying the annotations is required.
        <br>
        <div class="row text-center">
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-agreement-overview-lvl-0_1_web.png"/>
        </div>
        Once the filter is constructed and you hit
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Refresh</button>,
        a list of all eligible annotations will be shown.
        <p>
            In the top right corner of the list, you will see the total number of annotations in the query as well as the annotations
            shown on the current page.
            Navigate through the pages using the pagination controls at the bottom left of the table, or change the total number
            of items displayed on one page by clicking a number at the bottom right of the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this list, the first column shows a preview of the annotation, which can be enlarged by clicking on the thumbnail.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second column contains one bar chart for each individual term that was assigned by any of the users.
            The bars are sorted primarily by their agreement and secondarily by their term name.
            Below the bar chart, the name of the term is displayed and the percentage of users in this query that assigned the term.
            In brackets, the total number of users assigning this term is displayed.
            In addition to that, an orange <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign" style="color:orangered;"></span> icon may indicate
            that a particular term has been assigned by one user only and that the agreement on this term may be invalid.
            Let the mouse rest on the icon and additional information will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subsequent columns contain the users' assignments, alphabetically ordered ascending that lead to the statistics
            visualized as horizontal bar chart in the second column.
        </p>

        <h5>Filtering Agreement Levels</h5>
        Usually the agreement is not filtered (0%) and thus, all annotations are shown in the list.
        Agreement can be filtered using the slider control at the top of the annotation list.
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6 text-center">
                <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-agreement-slider-0.png"/>
                <br>
                <b>Slider in leftmost position, no agreement filtering.</b>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 text-center">
                <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-agreement-slider-2.png"/>
                <br>
                <b>Slider in position 2, agreement filtering for 2 or more users agreeing on a term.</b>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            As the slider is moved to the right, the list usually becomes shorter but the confidence on the selected terms
            increases.
            For instance, if you move the slider to the rightmost position, you will only get agreements, where all users in your
            query agreed.
