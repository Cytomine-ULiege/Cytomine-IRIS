    <h4>Project Statistics Dashboard</h4>
    The project statistics dashboard is divided into tabs, which allow different views on the annotations.
    <ul>
        <li><b>User Statistics</b>: lets you combine various filters and view the histogram of assigned labels for
            one or more users.
        </li>
        <li><b>Annotation Agreements</b>: lets you combine various filters and view inter-observer agreement on the annotations.
        </li>
    </ul>
    In both cases, a filter panel as shown below allows you to construct your query.
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>User Filter</b>
            <br>
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-filterpanel-1.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>Ontology Filter</b>
            <br>
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-filterpanel-2.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>Image Filter</b>
            <br>
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-filterpanel-3.png"/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>Well, I don't see the filter!?</h5>
        <p>
            The filter panel can be hidden by selecting the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span> icon
            or clicking the gray bar on the left side of the window.
            Similarly, the panel can be shown by selecting the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> icon
            or clicking the gray bar on the left side of the window.
        </p>

    <h4>User Statistics</h4>
    User statistics allow a complete picture of all terms assigned by one or more particular users.
    Select users from the left hand side you want to examine, choose one or more terms or images and then select
    <span class="btn btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Refresh</span> in the main view.
    <br>
    You can also hide the filter panel by clicking on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span> icon
    or the grey bar at the left border of the window.

    <div class="text-center" style="margin-top:20px;">
        <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-user-histogram.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            For each user there will be one histogram and two progress bars.
            The histogram contains the filtered labels and hovering the bars in the chart indicates the frequency of that term
            for the user.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The name of the user</li>
                <li>Total number of annotations labeled by the user</li>
                <li>Total number of annotations with one or more labels</li>
                <li>Total number of annotations (also includes annotations without labels)</li>
            </ol>
            The first progress bar indicates the progress relative to the observer who labeled most annotations of all users,
            which is the total number of annotations by the user divided by all annotations with labels.
            So example, if the first progressbar is at 100%, this means that this particular user has assigned most of all terms.
            <br>
            The second progress bar indicates the overall progress: total number of labeled annotations by the user divided by all annotations.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">

        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h4>Annotation Agreements</h4>
        The agreements among particular users can be viewed by selecting this tab.
        Similar to the user statistics, you can construct a query by using the filter panels shown on the left hand side.
        Also, this panel can be hidden by clicking on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span> if more
        space for displaying the annotations is required.
        <br>
        <div class="row text-center">
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-agreement-overview-lvl-0_1_web.png"/>
        </div>
        Once the filter is constructed and you hit
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Refresh</button>,
        a list of all eligible annotations will be shown.
        In this list, the first column shows a preview of the annotation.
