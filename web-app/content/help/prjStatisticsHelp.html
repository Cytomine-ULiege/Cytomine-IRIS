        <h4>Project Statistics Dashboard</h4>
        The project statistics dashboard is divided into tabs, which allow different views on the annotations.
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Statistics</b>: lets you combine various filters and view the histogram of assigned labels for
                one or more users.
            </li>
            <li><b>Annotation Agreements</b>: lets you combine various filters and view inter-observer agreement on the annotations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        In both cases, a filter panel as shown below allows you to construct your query.
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>User Filter</b>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <b>Ontology Filter</b>
            <br>
            <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-filterpanel-2.png"/>

    <h4>User Statistics</h4>
    User statistics allow a complete picture of all terms assigned by one or more particular users.
    Select users from the left hand side you want to examine, choose one or more terms or images and then select
    <span class="btn btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Refresh</span> in the main view.
    <br>
    You can also hide the filter panel by clicking on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span> icon
    or the grey bar at the left border of the window.

    <div class="text-center" style="margin-top:20px;">
        <img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/stats-user-histogram.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        For each user there will be one histogram and two progress bars.
        The histogram contains the filtered labels and hovering the bars in the chart indicates the frequency of that term
        for the user.
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The name of the user</li>
            <li>Total number of annotations labeled by the user</li>
            <li>Total number of annotations with one or more labels</li>
            <li>Total number of annotations (also includes annotations without labels)</li>
        </ol>
        The first progressbar indicates the progress relative to the observer who labeled most annotations of all users,
        which is the total number of annotations by the user divided by all annotations with labels.
        So example, if the first progressbar is at 100%, this means that this particular user has assigned most of all terms.
        <br>
        The second progressbar indicates the overall progress: total number of labeled annotations by the user divided by all annotations.
