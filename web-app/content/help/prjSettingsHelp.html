        <h4>Access Management</h4>

        <p>
            Generally, you can enable or disable particular projects and images for particular users, but this requires
            you to
            be a project coordinator.
            As a project coordinator you are able to view and alter access rights to the project and each image per user
            and
            authorize other users as project coordinator as well.
        </p>
        All project users are listed in a table in the page, and a short summary is displayed right above the table.
        If there is just a single project coordinator in this project, the number is replaced with the name of that
        user,
        otherwise, hovering the number will display all coordinators of the project (also if they are on different pages
        of the
        user table).
        <ul>
            <li><b>User ID:</b> the Cytomine user ID</li>
            <li><b>Last Name:</b> the user's last name</li>
            <li><b>First Name:</b> the user's first name</li>
            <li><b>Username:</b> the user's user name</li>
            <li><b>Enabled:</b> a flag indicating whether or not the user has access to this project on this IRIS host
            </li>
            <li><b>Coordinator:</b> a flag indicating whether or not the user is a coordinator of this project on this
                IRIS host
            </li>
            <li><b>Actions:</b>
                <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-edit"></span>&nbsp;
                    Edit Image Access
                </button>
                : this will open a modal dialog, displaying all images in the project, where you can enable and
                disable each image for the user.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div style="margin-top:15px;">
            <h5>Project Coordinator</h5>
            In order to establish a person as a coordinator, select the user's check box in the column
            <b>Coordinator</b>.
            If you authorize someone as coordinator, the project will automatically be enabled for that user.
            Moreover, the user will receive an email indicating that coordinator rights are now available for that
            project.
            <br>
            Similarly, deselect the check box, if you want to revoke the user's rights as coordinator.
            <p>
                <span class="label label-warning">Please note:</span> You cannot remove yourself as a project
                coordinator.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-top:15px;">
            <h5>Project Access</h5>
            Project access is granted by selecting the user's check box in the column <b>Enabled</b>.
            Disable the project for a user by deselecting the check box.
            <p>
                <span class="label label-warning">Please note:</span> You cannot disable the project for yourself.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-top:15px;">
            <h5>Image Access</h5>
            Open the images for a user by selecting
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-edit"></span>&nbsp;
                Edit Image Access
            </button>
            from the table. This will open a modal dialog, where you can enable and disable the images using the check
            box from the rightmost column.
            The summary at the top of the table will be updated accordingly.

        <h4>Labeling Progress Update/Synchronization</h4>

        From the tabs, select <b>Synchronization</b> to view the corresponding settings.
        <p>
            Computing the labeling progress for each user in an image is a rather expensive operation and is just
            executed <i>automatically</i>
            at very specific moments during a workflow in the application.
            Nevertheless, as a coordinator, you can trigger synchronization manually either for all users (using the big
            red button ;-)) or for individual users by pressing
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Sync now</span>
            </button>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            While synchronization is in progress, the buttons will be deactivated and become reactivated when the
            procedure is finished.
        </p>
