		<li>
			<b>Name:</b> the name of the Cytomine project. A label indicating
			<span class="label label-warning">Locked</span> indicates
			that you do not have access to this project. Hover the label to receive more information.

		<li><b>Created:</b> the creation date</li>
		<li><b># Images:</b> the total number of images in this project</li>

	Per default, the projects are sorted by creation date, such that the most recent project is displayed on top of the table.
	Click on the column titles to change the sort order in the table. You can also search for a specific project name using the text field in the <b>Name</b> column.

	<h4>Available Actions</h4>
	<div class="text-center"><img class="img-rounded dropshadowimg" alt="" src="images/help/project-help-dropdown.png"/></div>
	<p>
		Select one of the available actions for your task. Any user that has no access to a project can request it from the
		project coordinators using the <b>Request Access</b> link. Once the user has access, this button is not visible to them.
		Some other buttons may be deactivated according to your current rights (i.e. being a coordinator for that project or not).
		The available actions are detailed in the following sections.
	</p>

	<h5 style="margin-top:15px;">Opening a Project</h5>
	<p>
		Open a project by clicking on the <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Open</button> button in the row of the project's name.
		If the button is disabled <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" disabled="disabled">Open</button>, the project is not (yet) available to you or does not have any images to be examined.
	</p>

	<h5 style="margin-top:15px;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock"></span> Request Access</h5>
	<p>
		If the project is <span class="label label-warning">Locked</span>, you can request access by clicking on the dropdown
		button and selecting <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-default"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock"></span> Request Access</button>.
		<br>
		A dialog will guide you through the request process. The request will be sent to the project <i>coordinators</i>, who will
		eventually grant access to the project. You can submit a short message to the coordinators as well.
		Once the coordinator granted you access, you will be notified via email.
		<br>
		If there is no coordinator set yet for that project, you can request to become one yourself.
		<br>
		<b>Please note:</b> If you already have access to the project, this button will not be visible to you.
	</p>

	<h5 style="margin-top:15px;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> Coordinator Request</h5>
	<p>
		If you want to become a coordinator of the project, e.g. to alter settings and view project statistics, select
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-default"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> Coordinator Request</button>
		from the dropdown.
		<br>
		A dialog will guide you through the request process. The request will be sent to the <i>administrator</i> of the IRIS host, who will
		eventually authorize you as coordinator of the project. You can submit a short message to the administrator as well.
		Once you are authorized, you will be notified via email.
		<br>
	</p>

	<h5 style="margin-top:15px;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> Settings (Coordinators only)</h5>
	<p>
		Opens the project settings and lets you edit project and image access rights for all users. Furthermore, the labeling
		progress for each user can be updated manually from the Cytomine host.
	</p>

	<h5 style="margin-top:15px;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats"></span> Statistics Dashboard (Coordinators only)</h5>
	<p>
		Opens the project statistics dashboard and reveals user statistics and agreement visualizations on the annotations.
